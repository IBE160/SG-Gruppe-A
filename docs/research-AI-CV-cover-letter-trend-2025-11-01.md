# Market Research Report: AI CV & Cover Letter Web Application in Norway

## Executive Summary

**Market Opportunity:**
The Norwegian job market presents a significant opportunity for an AI-powered web application that assists with CV and cover letter creation. There is a clear and growing trend of AI adoption in HR and job applications, with a substantial portion of Norwegian job seekers already utilizing AI tools. While the market is competitive, a hyper-localized solution focusing on Norwegian language nuances, cultural expectations, and integration with local platforms can carve out a strong niche.

**Key Insights:**
1.  **Strong User Demand:** A significant percentage of Norwegian job seekers are already using AI for CVs and cover letters, indicating a clear demand for such tools.
2.  **Competitive Landscape:** The market is currently served by several international and some local AI-powered CV/cover letter builders. Differentiation through superior localization and user experience is crucial.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
