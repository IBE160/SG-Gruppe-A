**Date:** 2025-12-13
**Facilitator:** SM (Bob)
**Participants:** Dev, Architect, Product Owner

## Executive Summary
Epic 3 focused on the core AI value proposition: generating personalized cover letters. The team successfully implemented the generation logic, display, and export functionalities (copy/download). All planned stories (3.1 - 3.4) were completed.

## Status Overview
- **Epic Status:** Completed
- **Stories Completed:** 4/4
  - 3.1 Cover Letter Generation
  - 3.2 Display Generated Cover Letter
  - 3.3 Copy Cover Letter
  - 3.4 Download Cover Letter
- **Unfinished Work:** None

## What Went Well (Wins)
- **AI Integration:** The integration with the LLM for cover letter generation (Story 3.1) was successful and produces coherent outputs.
- **Frontend Utility:** The "Copy" and "Download" features (3.3, 3.4) were implemented quickly and work reliably across browsers.
- **Velocity:** The team maintained a good pace, moving through the stories efficiently.

## Challenges & Learnings
- **Validation findings:** Minor issues were identified during the validation of Story 3.4 (Download Cover Letter), specifically related to browser compatibility or file encoding, which were addressed.
- **Prompt Engineering:** Fine-tuning the prompt for the cover letter generation took some iteration to ensure the tone matched user expectations (Formal/Creative options).

## Action Items
- [ ] **Archive Epic 3:** Mark as fully complete in all tracking systems.
- [ ] **Prepare for Epic 4 (Accessibility):** Ensure that the generated text areas and buttons from Epic 3 are fully accessible (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation) as we move into Story 4.2.
- [ ] **User Testing:** Recommend a round of user testing to validate the *quality* of the generated letters before full launch.

## Next Steps
- Focus shifts to **Epic 4: Responsive & Accessible UI**.
- Story 4.1 is already marked as done.
- Next priority is **Story 4.2: Accessibility Compliance**.
